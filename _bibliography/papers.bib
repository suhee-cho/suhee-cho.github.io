  abstract    = "ABSTRACT Animals rapidly and flexibly adapt their behavior to
                 their environment, and this is thought to depend on the
                 formation of an internal cognitive map. The cognitive map has
                 been studied at multiple levels of description, from abstract
                 theory to neural implementation, with a focus on the role of
                 learned representations in the hippocampus. Here, we (1)
                 extend the seminal successor representation theory of the
                 cognitive map, weighting it by factors collectively labeled
                 perceived salience and using it to predict environmental
                 features encountered at different places in the environment
                 and (2) employ behavioral time-scale synaptic plasticity
                 (BTSP), a form of rapid neural adaptation, to capture rapid
                 map formation and behavioral adaptation. In the resulting
                 model, hippocampal area CA3 uses temporally symmetric BTSP to
                 encode spatiotemporal proximity experienced during
                 exploration, area CA1 uses temporally asymmetric BTSP to
                 encode a perceived salience-weighted successor representation,
                 and downstream areas learn to predict environmental features
                 that can guide behavior in accordance with a animal's needs
                 and goals. Through simulations of a rodent exploring a maze,
                 we show that our model can learn this representation rapidly,
                 and further strengthen it through spontaneous replay activity
                 during subsequent offline periods. Predictions of
                 environmental features also develop rapidly, and behavioral
                 simulations show how these learned representations give rise
                 to need-dependent choice, rapid behavioral adaptation to
                 changes in the availability of reward, and one-trial shock
                 avoidance learning.",

               (DNN) models encounter challenges in achieving human-like
               continual learning due to catastrophic forgetting. Here, we
               propose a metaplasticity model inspired by human working memory,
               enabling DNNs to perform catastrophic forgetting-resistant
               continual learning without any pre- or post-processing. A key
               aspect of our approach involves implementing distinct types of
               synapses from stable to flexible, and randomly intermixing them
               to train synaptic connections with different degrees of
               flexibility. This strategy allowed the network to successfully
               learn a continuous stream of information, even under unexpected
               changes in input length. The model achieved a balanced tradeoff
               between memory capacity and performance without requiring
               additional training or structural modifications, dynamically
               allocating memory resources to retain both old and new
               information. Furthermore, the model demonstrated robustness
               against data poisoning attacks by selectively filtering out
               erroneous memories, leveraging the Hebb repetition effect to
               reinforce the retention of significant data.",

  abstract  = "The cortex plays a crucial role in various perceptual and
               cognitive functions, driven by its basic unit, the canonical
               cortical microcircuit. Yet, we remain short of a framework that
               definitively explains the structure-function relationships of
               this fundamental neuroanatomical motif. To better understand how
               physical substrates of cortical circuitry facilitate their
               neuronal dynamics, we employ a computational approach using
               recurrent neural networks and representational analyses. We
               examine the differences manifested by the inclusion and
               exclusion of biologically motivated interareal laminar
               connections on the computational roles of different neuronal
               populations in the microcircuit of hierarchically related areas
               throughout learning. Our findings show that the presence of
               feedback connections correlates with the functional
               modularization of cortical populations in different layers and
               provides the microcircuit with a natural inductive bias to
               differentiate expected and unexpected inputs at initialization,
               which we justify mathematically. Furthermore, when testing the
               effects of training the microcircuit and its variants with a
               predictive-coding-inspired strategy, we find that doing so helps
               better encode noisy stimuli in areas of the cortex that receive
               feedback, all of which combine to suggest evidence for a
               predictive-coding mechanism serving as an intrinsic operative
               logic in the cortex.",
