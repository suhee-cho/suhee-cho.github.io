#### Welcome, folks!	:smiley_cat:
I'm Suhee, a post-baccalaureate researcher advised by Dr. Jay McClelland at [Stanford Psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu/). Before joining Jay's lab, I was an undergraduate student at [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr), studying bio & brain engineering and biological sciences.

**My research interests center on how we learn and form memories :brain:** In more technical terms, how we build internal models of the external world, how these representations are maintained, and how they are used to guide adaptive behavior. I explore these questions primarily through connectionist models (Yes, I have a small artificial brain, coded by me, running on my computer!	:computer:	). You can dig further into my recent projects on my [project page](/projects/).

**Beyond research, I enjoy writing	:pencil2:** Not only about science, but also about life and the random thoughts. For anybody who is interested, I share some of them on my [blog page](/blog/). **Other than that, I love staying active!**	:muscle:	Living in the San Francisco Bay Area means easy access to beautiful hiking trails and parks! I enjoy hiking, running, roller skating, and skateboarding. I've also been doing CrossFit for over four years.

<!-- Hello folks! I am Suhee Cho. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
